##JCLAS notes
To deploy to github pages (jclas.github.io) 
- create a gh-pages branch on github
- use the ng deploy in the terminal command line (angular-cli) on your local master branch clone in VS Code
- answer the deploy questions as they come up.
- notice everything is "compiled" on the new branch on github
- You will notice when you browse the deployment url eveything is 404 from the index.html. Tweak the index.html's base href uri from "/" to "/brewery/" if the deployment is to "jclas.github.io/brewery"
- I might have forgotten a thing or 2 to put here.
